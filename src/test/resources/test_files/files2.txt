	Full of vexation come I, with complaint
	Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
	Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
	This man hath my consent to marry her.
	Stand forth, Lysander: and, my gracious duke,
	This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child:
	Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rimes,
	And interchang'd love-tokens with my child;
	Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
	With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;
	And stol'n the impression of her fantasy
	With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
	Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
	Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth;
	With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;
	Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
	To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious duke,
	Be it so she will not here before your Grace
	Consent to marry with Demetrius,
	I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
	As she is mine, I may dispose of her;
	Which shall be either to this gentleman,
	Or to her death, according to our law
	Immediately provided in that case.
